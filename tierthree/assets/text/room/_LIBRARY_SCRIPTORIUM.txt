The information is edited to be as consice and standardized as possible and allows for easy access to information from many different sources and authors.

The Scriptorium works a lot like the library itself does. Research points are gained overwhelmingly slower and substantial quantities of paper are used for correspondance and drafts, but they can hold 5x the information and knowledge is lost at a tenth of the rate!",
