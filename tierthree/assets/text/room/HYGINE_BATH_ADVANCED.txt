Ultimately, this means your workers will be able to fill more of their needs as they will have less individual needs to fulfill each day. However, it will interrupt work for longer periods of time. Ultimately, Spa Springs functions as a strong mid-to-late game building to push the boundaries of happiness in well designed cities. If properly placed in proximity of other services, will not impact productivity too much.",
