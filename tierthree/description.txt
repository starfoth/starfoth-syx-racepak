[u]New Tier 3 Buildings[/u]

[b]Comfortable Apartments[/b] - High quality flats. The size of a chamber but with 4 beds to fit a whole family!
[b]Rec Room[/b] - High quality tavern. Auxiliaries increase quality by 1/2 and rugs are not an option (floor is carpeted), but has increased max happiness.
[b]Restaurant[/b] - High quality canteen. Chefs make gourmet and lavish meals. 1/2 as fast but much higher happiness. 

[u]New Tier 2 Buildings[/u]
[b]Buffet[/b] - Efficient eatery. Requires a cooking station to prepare meals but does not grant happiness beyond the canteen, simply makes the meals more filling.
[b]Restroom[/b] - High quality lavatory. Requires less work from plumbers as each spot is used multiple times before needing to be fixed but requires components and ergonomic furniture.
[b]Rest Area[/b] - High quality hearth. Uses cut stone and ergonomic furniture. 2x as big and comes in multiple sizes.
[b]Showers[/b] - High quality well. Uses components and grants more happiness than the well but less than the bathhouse.
