Replaces the PLAYER'S GOVERNMENT ONLY with a Glorian-styled military dictatorship. FOR CAT AND COUNTRY!
16 officers to appoint. Military dictatorship flavor. Different rank bonuses that yield military benefits. And replaces the throne with a dictatorship-styled office desk that has a nice carpet and rug rather than ugly and uncomfy stone. 

[u]The Throne[/u]
The throne will be replaced with a carpeted office. It comes complete with an office chair and desk. Rather than improving the quality of either, more paperwork, knicknacks, and a mug will be added as you level up. At Dictator rank (previously "emperor") you will be granted a golden pen

[u]Levels/Ranks[/u]
Happiness bonus will be reduced and supplemented with a combat and submission bonus. Additionally, ranks have been rethemed to become military ranks at lower levels, then site director, then governor, then minor dictator and finally Dictator!
